Capstone project _ CS687
The online shopping mall shopping system certainly cannot be excluded. The online shopping mall system is a management system built using the spring boot framework with a practical use as the development background and software engineering principles and methods(Gutierrez, 2014). The development process starts with a requirement analysis of the software system, and the system's primary functions are derived. The overall design mainly includes the system function design, system structure design, system data structure design, system security design, etc.
Furthermore, the detailed plan mainly consists of implementing the system database access, the specific implementation of the main functional modules, the module implementation key code, etc. Finally, the system is tested, the test results are analyzed and summarized, and the shortcomings and areas for improvement are identified. Furthermore, this personalized online management system pays special attention to interactive coordination and management interplay, which benefits the online shopping mall system.
The database used for this online shopping mall system is MySQL, developed using the spring boot framework. As a result, the system code is guaranteed to be well readable, practical, easy to expand, universal, easy to maintain later, easy to operate, and concise pages in the design process.
